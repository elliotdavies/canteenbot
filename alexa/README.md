# Alexa

The `alexa` function makes CanteenBot available via an Amazon Alexa skill,
available [here](http://alexa.amazon.co.uk/spa/index.html?#skills/dp/B01M4IGA2S)
on the skill store.

The name of the skill is TNB Canteen and you can invoke it with `news canteen`.
For example:

- "Alexa, open news canteen"
- "Alexa, ask news canteen what's for lunch today"
- "Alexa, ask news canteen what's on the menu tomorrow"

The Alexa skill does not currently support ingredient queries.
